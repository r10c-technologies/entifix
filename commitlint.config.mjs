 * ESM rather than the `.js` this used to be, because the attribution predicate
 * is an ES module and a CommonJS config cannot
 * import one without a top-level `await` it is not allowed to have. commitlint
 * 21 resolves `commitlint.config.mjs` natively, and the CommonJS presets below
 * import fine through interop.
 *
 * This is the repository's first `rules` entry. Everything the conventional and
 * Nx-scope presets check is shaped around the subject line — type, scope, case,
 * length — so nothing here has ever looked at the body or its trailers, which
 * is exactly where AI attribution lands.
