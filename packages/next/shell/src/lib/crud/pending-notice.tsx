/**
 * What became of the writes this browser started but the server has not
 * finished.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This is the list's surface because the tab strip cannot be.** Only
 * creates are transactional (`create: 'command'` fires on `isCreate` alone), and
 * a create has no workspace tab — `EntityEditorTab` takes a required id, so
 * `master:<key>` is the list and there is no address for a record that does not
 * exist yet. A badge keyed on a pending record id would therefore be unreachable
 * by construction, which is exactly the "declared, styled, never produced"
 * defect ADR 0043 was written about. It renders here instead, where
 * `afterSave()` actually puts the operator.
 *
 * `role="status"`, not `role="alert"` — the `BulkResult` reasoning: an outcome
 * to read, not an interruption.
 *
 * The failure headline is a catalog key and never `entry.reason`, which is free
 * text from whatever threw, in whatever language that code was written in. The
 * reason is kept as secondary, explicitly-unlocalized detail; a translatable
 * failure needs an error *code* on the event, which is ADR 0043's residual.
