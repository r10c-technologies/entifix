 * Turns a fixed list of pickers into the `linkSources` map `EntityForm` takes.
 *
 * **Why the rule is disabled below.** `links` is built once, at factory time,
 * and closed over by the generated form — it is the same array object on every
 * render of a given component, so the hook count is fixed. That is exactly the
 * invariant `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` exists to protect and exactly the one
 * it cannot see, because it reasons syntactically about the loop rather than
 * about the array's provenance. The loop is isolated in this module so the
 * disable is written once, with its reason, instead of once per generated form.
 *
 * The alternative — one child component per picker, reporting its source
 * upward — would put the sources one render behind the draft that feeds them,
 * which is a stale suggestion list rather than a lint error.
