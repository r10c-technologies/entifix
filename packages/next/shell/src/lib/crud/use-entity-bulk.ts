 * The selection lives here rather than inside `EntityTable` because it has to
 * survive pagination, and the page owns the pager — a selection reset by the
 * very navigation used to add to it would make "select rows across pages"
 * impossible.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth not re-deriving. **The selection survives the action**
 * (#121): after a run the rows stay ticked, because the operator's next act is
 * usually to retry the failures or to run a second verb on the same rows, and
 * re-selecting forty rows to do it is the whole cost the bulk bar exists to
 * remove. And **a retry re-runs only the failures**, as an `ids` selection
 * built from the outcomes — never the original selection, which would redo the
 * successful rows and, for a `matching` selection, re-resolve a filter whose
 * answer has just changed underneath it.
