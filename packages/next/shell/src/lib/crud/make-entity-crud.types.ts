/**
 * The `entity` catalog keys that carry **both** form titles, a `label` and a
 * `plural`.
 *
 * Derived from the Spanish catalog rather than written out, so the union is the
 * catalog: an entity whose subtree has no `form.editTitle`/`form.newTitle`
 * cannot be handed to {@link makeEntityCrud} at all, and adding a reference
 * entity therefore starts by adding its copy to both locales. That is the whole
 * i18n gate for this factory — `@r10c/i18n-check` scans only
 * `packages/business/ts` for `@useCase()` decorators and never `.tsx`, so a
 * runtime key here would be checked by nothing.
 *
 * `label`/`plural` joined the condition when {@link EntityCrud} began carrying
 * them, so that a workspace tab and a nav entry derived from this descriptor
 * name the entity in the catalog's own words. They are part of the **type**
 * rather than a runtime assertion in the factory, because the catalog is
 * statically known here: a missing `plural` should fail at the call site that
 * generates the screens, not on the render that first tries to title a tab.
 *
 * Keeping the key typed is what lets the generated form call `useT('entity')`
 * with a template literal and still fail the build on a typo, instead of
 * reaching for the `useTranslateKey` escape hatch that authored copy must not
 * use. `AccountLabelKey` in `../session/account-links.ts` is the same trick
 * written out by hand; this one cannot drift because it is computed.
