/**
 * Builds a same-origin proxy for one backend service, mounted as a catch-all

 *
 * The browser can never call `:310N` directly: `entifix_at` is httpOnly and
 * same-origin, so a cross-origin request carries no cookie and a guarded route
 * answers `401`. Host-scoping the cookie does not help — that governs which host
 * *stores* it, not which cross-origin requests send it. Routing through the app's
 * own origin makes the cookie automatic and needs no CORS, which is the same
 * reason the credential routes are shaped this way.
 *
 * The cookie is forwarded upstream as a bearer token. **This proxy grants
 * nothing** — the service still verifies the token and applies its own
 * `requirePermission`. It only carries.
 *
 * It also carries the **caching contract** in both directions, which it did not
 * always: rebuilding every response as a fresh body dropped `ETag`,
 * `Cache-Control` and `Vary`, and forwarded no `If-None-Match`. The effect was
 * invisible and entirely wasteful — `GET /api/<entity>/$metadata` computes and
 * hashes a permission-filtered document per request, and a validator that never
 * reaches the service means it can never answer `304`. Worse, `Vary` is a
 * *correctness* header here: the document differs per caller, and one stripped
 * of `Vary: Cookie, Authorization` may be cached and served to a different
 * principal.
 *
 * A factory, because a host mounts one of these per backend it talks to, and
 * back-office-app now talks to two: marketplace-admin-service for the catalog a
 * vendor authors, marketplace-service for the platform vocabulary it is
 * classified in (ADR 0022).
