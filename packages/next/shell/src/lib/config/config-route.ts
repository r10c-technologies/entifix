 * session cookie and gets a `401` — `entifix_at` is httpOnly and same-origin, and
 * host-scoping it does not help, since that governs which host stores the cookie
 * rather than which cross-origin requests send it.
 *
 * So each service domain is swapped for a path on this app's own origin before
 * the browser ever sees it, which leaves the entity adapters unaware that a proxy
 * exists at all. `map` is keyed by the configuration key, e.g.
 * `{ 'config-service-domain': '/api/system' }`.
 *
 * Keys absent from `map` are passed through untouched, so an app only names the
 * domains it actually proxies.
