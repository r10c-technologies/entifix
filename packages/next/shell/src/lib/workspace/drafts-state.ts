/**
 * Per-address edit drafts, persisted to IndexedDB so an in-progress edit
 * survives a refresh. Keyed by the tab's `?tab=` param (its address), a draft is
 * whatever the editor needs to restore its fields; it exists until the user
 * saves (or discards). This is the "continuous autosave" seam — workspace-host
 * only, so a plain route stays ephemeral.
 *
 * **A draft is JSON round-trippable, period.** It is written through
 * `createJSONStorage`, so a class instance, an `EntityLink` or a `Date` does not
 * "mostly survive" — it comes back as something else, silently. {@link JsonValue}
 * is the compile-time half of that rule and {@link mergeDrafts} the runtime half.
 * Note that `UiPreferencesState`, the other persisted client store, writes
 * through IndexedDB's structured clone and *does* keep a `Date`; the two
 * contracts differ and must not be conflated.
