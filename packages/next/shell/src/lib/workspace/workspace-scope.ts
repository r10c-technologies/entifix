 * (`entity:product-specification:<id>`) and a record id is tenant-scoped, so a
 * draft written under one organization and restored under another would post
 * into the wrong tenant.
 *
 * The organization is part of the key for that reason, not only the user: a
 * party may hold several memberships and switching re-mints the token
