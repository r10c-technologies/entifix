 * plain route, outside any `WorkspaceShell` (a generated list still uses plain
 * `href`s — ADR 0042's own residual). A store mounted inside the workspace would
 * be written to by nothing, or — worse — written to *before* `persist.setOptions`
 * had scoped it, which is the unscoped cross-account restore ADR 0032 exists to
 * prevent. So `PendingTransactionsProvider` sits at the authenticated layout
 * instead, above both.
 *
 * It shares the workspace's IndexedDB database because it is the same browser
 * profile and the same scope key, not because it is the same concern.
