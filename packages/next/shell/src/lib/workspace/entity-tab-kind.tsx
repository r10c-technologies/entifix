/**
 * An entity tab kind: `<type>:<key>` for a list, `<type>:<key>:<id>` for one
 * record.
 *
 * **The list and the record are not different kinds.** They are the same screen
 * with and without a record, which is exactly what the optional id in the
 * payload says — three kinds (`catalog:`, `entity:`, `system:`) collapsed into
 * one for that reason, and the prefix names the *taxonomy* now
 * ([ADR 0042](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0042-the-workspace-address-is-the-taxonomy-serialized.md)).
 *
 * A factory over the {@link ScreenType} rather than a constant, and that is the
 * whole of what makes an Operaciones screen addressable. It was written inline
 * in back-office-app as a `masterKind`, so `master:` was the only entity
 * address any host could resolve and `operation:` matched nothing at all — a
 * second copy of this parser beside it is exactly the drift the registry was
 * consolidated to stop, and the two would have had to agree about a grammar
 * neither owns.
 *
 * Which screens a host offers stays the host's decision — a second host
 * mounting the same shells may want a different set — so the screens arrive as
 * an argument. What no longer varies is how one is addressed.
 *
 * `render` takes the id rather than a component, so the caller decides what
 * hosting a record means: in a workspace that is an editor wired to an
 * address-keyed autosaved draft, and the address it keys on has to carry this
 * same `type`.
