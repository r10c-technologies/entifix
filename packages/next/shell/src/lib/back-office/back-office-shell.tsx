 * **Collapse has two inputs, and only one of them is a preference.** The stored
 * choice is the person's; a `rail`-width viewport forces the compact form
 * whatever they chose. They are kept apart deliberately: writing the forced
 * value back would mean a single visit at a narrow width silently rewrites the
 * choice, and the sidebar comes back collapsed on the desktop the person set it
 * expanded on.
 *
 * Below `rail` the sidebar is not a sidebar at all — it is a drawer, built on
 * Headless UI's `Dialog` for the focus trap, `Escape` handling, backdrop click
 * and focus restoration that a hand-rolled one has to get right and usually does
 * not. There is exactly one `SidebarNav` in the tree either way; rendering a
 * second copy for the drawer is how the two drift.
