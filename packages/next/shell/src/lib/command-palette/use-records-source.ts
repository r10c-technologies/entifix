 * knows a keystroke is not a query. So this owns the debounce, the abort and the
 * two-character floor, while the route owns the fan-out, the per-source timeout
 * and the authorization.
 *
 * **No index, ever.** Every option here came back from `/api/search` for this
 * principal and this organization, on this keystroke. A prefetched client index
 * is the shape that surfaces another organization's record the first time a
 * session's scope moves under it, and ADR 0040 forecloses it permanently.
 *
 * Below the two-character floor the group is present and **says why** rather
 * than being empty or absent: empty would claim nothing matched a search that
 * never ran, and absent would leave someone wondering whether records are
 * searchable here at all.
