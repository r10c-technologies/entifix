/**
 * The workspace's open tabs, as one group.
 *
 * Read straight from the store rather than through a prop, because the palette
 * is mounted in the chrome and the tabs are the workspace's — there is no
 * component between them to thread it through.
 *
 * ⚠️ Outside `/workspace` the store is deliberately **unhydrated**
 * (`skipHydration: true`, rehydrated by `WorkspaceShell`), so this group is
 * empty there and the palette drops it. That is right rather than a limitation:
 * a tab is a thing you can return to inside the workspace, and offering one from
 * a plain route would navigate somewhere the person did not ask to be.
 *
 * Selecting one is a **deep link**, not a store call: `?tab=` is the tab's
 * address (ADR 0042), so the workspace focuses it on arrival and the palette
 * does not have to be inside the workspace tree to reach the store's actions.
