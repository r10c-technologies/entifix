 * did not exist, so a verb declared there was granted, exported, passed every
 * `@r10c/slices` invariant and simply never appeared.
 *
 * The descriptors are **served, not imported**: `$metadata` filters them through
 * `PolicyDecisionTag` against the verified principal, which is a stronger check
 * than anything the browser could do — and it keeps every `@useCase()` class's
 * `Effect` body, repository tags and import closure out of the client bundle.
 *
 * ⚠️ A descriptor with **no handler throws**, at the first render of the
 * palette rather than on the click. A verb that appears and does nothing is
 * worse than one that is absent: it reads as a broken feature rather than a
 * missing wire, and it is the same posture `assertSearchable` and `surfaceFor`
 * already take.
