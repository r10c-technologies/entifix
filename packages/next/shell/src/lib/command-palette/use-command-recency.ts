 * a kind of result lands; letting use move a whole group would take that away
 * for a convenience nobody asked for. Inside a group there is no such contract,
 * so the last thing you ran comes first.
 *
 * Stored as **one keyed record**, not a key per command — the same reasoning
 * `back-office:nav-collapsed-groups` records: `useUiPreference` resolves after
 * mount, so N keys are N first-paint transitions while one read settles the
 * whole palette at once.
 *
 * A record group is deliberately left alone: its options are records, whose ids
 * are primary keys, so remembering them would build a list of which records this
 * person opened inside a UI preference. Only commands and destinations are
 * ranked.
