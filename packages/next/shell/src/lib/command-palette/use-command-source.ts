/**
 * The deterministic commands — "Nuevo producto", "Nuevo usuario" — as one group.
 *
 * **This hook filters; the palette does not.** Every source in the palette
 * arrives pre-filtered, because the record source is filtered by the service
 * that answered it and a component that filtered again would have to know which
 * groups were already narrowed.
 *
 * Commands declared on a sub-page do not appear at the root. What appears there
 * instead is one entry that descends into the page, which is what makes the
 * palette's first screen a short list of *kinds* of thing rather than one row
 * per creatable entity competing with the destinations beside them.
