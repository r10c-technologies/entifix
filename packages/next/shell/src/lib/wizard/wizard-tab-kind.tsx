 * the one thing [ADR 0045](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0045-the-wizard-a-step-graph-and-a-submit-that-hands-off.md)
 * changed about the address grammar — `screenAddress` and `parseScreenPayload`
 * already produced and accepted the shape.
 *
 * **The caption is the wizard's name and not the step's**, deliberately: a tab
 * whose title changed on every Siguiente would reflow the strip mid-flow and
 * make an open wizard hard to find again by the name it was opened under.
 *
 * A factory rather than a constant, for the reason `masterKind` is built in the
 * host: which screens a workspace offers is the host's decision, and the shells
 * that own the wizards may not import each other.
