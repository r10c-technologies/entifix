// It stays a separate entry so route handlers and cookie helpers are never
// reached through the client surface: stamped as client modules they would
// become client references and their `next/server` imports would fail. The
// library compiles per-file, so each module keeps its own `"use client"` (or
// keeps none, as here) instead of inheriting a bundle-wide banner.

// The shared fleet token, and the header config-service reads it from. Exported
// because a server component that reads config-service directly — rather than
// through its own app's `/api/config` route — has to carry it itself. It never
// reaches the browser: this is the server entry.

// The `[slug]` value that means "create". A pure constant, exported from both
// entries because both need it: the generated pages read it in the browser, and
// a shell's palette commands compose the create route with it on the server.

// host fans out over (ADR 0040).

// The access cookie, read once and forwarded as a bearer. Three server surfaces
// carry it the same way — the per-backend proxy, the auth shell's hand-written
// handlers, and the record search fan-out — and none of them grants anything.
export * from './lib/session/bearer';

// Account-link builders. Pure functions, but server layouts call them directly,
// and anything exported from the client entry becomes a client function.
