 * middleware matcher skips (`/api/health`, `/api/config`), which have no
 * user-facing copy anyway.

 * A header is a **dynamic** request input, so a page that calls this — or
 * {@link getServerT}, which does — can never be prerendered. That is the right
 * trade for an auth-gated app whose every response is personal anyway, and the
 * wrong one for a public storefront: marketplace-app therefore carries a real

 * {@link getServerTFor}.
