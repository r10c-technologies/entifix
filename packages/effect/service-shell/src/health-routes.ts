/**
 * Mount the probe endpoints on a router.

 * - `GET /api/health` — the original endpoint, unchanged. Kept because
 *   Playwright's `readyPath` and existing tooling point at it.
 * - `GET /api/health/live` — **liveness**. Answers from the process alone: no
 *   datastore, no config-service, no session. This is deliberate and load
 *   bearing. A liveness probe that checks dependencies turns a Mongo blip into
 *   "Kubernetes restarts every replica", which is an outage the probe caused.
 * - `GET /api/health/ready` — **readiness**: `200` when every registered probe
 *   passes, `503 {status:'degraded', failing:[…]}` otherwise. Kubernetes pulls
 *   a not-ready pod out of the load balancer without killing it, which is what
 *   a reconnecting client wants. A process that has begun terminating answers
 *   `503 {status:'terminating'}` instead, **before** any probe runs: nothing is
 *   failing, and running the probes would ask a closing pool a question whose
 *   answer changes nothing.
 *
 * The failing list carries probe **names** only — never a URI, host, or driver
 * message. This endpoint answers anyone who can reach the port.
