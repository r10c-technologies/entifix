 * needs — the values cannot be redacted here without breaking the boot the route
 * exists to serve. So the route is gated on a shared token instead, which closes

 *
 * This is deliberately **not** service identity: every caller presents the same
 * token, so it proves fleet membership and nothing more. Per-service credentials,
 * with the response scoped to the service that asked, are separate work; this is
 * the cheap step that stops the port from being self-serve.
 *
 * It lives here beside {@link loadRemoteConfiguration}, the client half of the
 * same protocol, so the header and the token cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Health endpoints are **not** guarded — a probe must answer without credentials,
 * or a readiness check becomes an authentication problem.
