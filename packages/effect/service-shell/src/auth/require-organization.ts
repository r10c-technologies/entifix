 * act-as-organization re-mint, never a widening of the default (ADR 0012) —
 * and a member of several organizations hits it before choosing one. The `code`
 * is a key in the shared `errors` catalog, so a client renders "select an
 * organization" instead of "forbidden" — a claim `@r10c/i18n-check` now holds

/**
 * Guard a **tenant-plane** handler: authenticate, check the permission, and
 * require that the session names an organization.
 *
 * **This is the first of exactly two ways a request resolves the organization
 * it acts for, and the only *user-facing* one**
 * ([ADR 0006](../../../../../../docs/adr/0006-multitenancy-planes-and-tenant-storage.md)).
 * The second is {@link requireServiceCrossing}: an explicit `organizationId`
 * presented with a service token *and* a narrow route permission, for a
 * platform-plane caller acting for an organization it was handed rather than one
 * it picked
 * ([ADR 0023](../../../../../../docs/adr/0023-service-to-service-tenant-crossing.md)).
 *
 * There is no third path, no fallback and no operator branch. A request
 * satisfying neither guard never reaches a tenant handle at all, which is what
 * keeps the most sensitive capability in the system from being the *absence* of
 * a condition.
 *
 * The organization is handed to the handler so it can resolve its own storage
 * through a `TenantDatabaseResolver`. Resolution happens **inside the request**
 * — the connection pool is a boot-time `Layer`, and a per-request `Layer` would
 * rebuild the pool per request.
 *
 * Here the value comes from the verified token and nowhere else. A route
 * parameter or a body field naming an organization would be caller-controlled,
 * which is the whole failure this guard exists to prevent — and is exactly why
 * the other path honours a caller-named organization only *after* the caller has
 * proved it is the fleet.
