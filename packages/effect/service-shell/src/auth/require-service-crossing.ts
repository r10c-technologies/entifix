/**
 * Guard a **service-to-service** tenant crossing: the second — and only other —
 * way a request resolves the organization it acts for.
 *
 * The first is {@link requireOrganization}, which reads the session's
 * `activeOrganizationId` and is the only *user-facing* resolution. This one
 * exists because a platform-plane caller sometimes acts for an organization the
 * principal is not a member of: checkout reserving a vendor's stock, where the
 * organization comes from the **item** and a buyer's session carries none — and
 * never will, since making a buyer a member of every vendor they buy from would
 * be a far worse breach than the problem it solved.
 *
 * There is no third path, no fallback and no operator branch. A request
 * satisfying neither guard simply never reaches a tenant handle
 * ([ADR 0023](../../../../../../docs/adr/0023-service-to-service-tenant-crossing.md);
 * ADR 0012's operator crossing is a *different* mechanism — a person choosing an
 * organization, which needs a human's permission, a time box and a `Crossing`
 * record).
 *
 * ⚠️ **This guard reads no cookie and no `Authorization` header, and that is
 * the design.** A route guarded here accepts the crossing token and nothing
 * else: two accepted credentials on one route means the weaker one is the
 * security level. It matters concretely — `super-admin` holds `*:*:*`, which
 * matches every crossing permission, so a route that also took a session would
 * be reachable by an operator's browser tab.
 *
 * Three checks, in this order, so nothing is revealed before fleet membership is
 * proven:
 *
 * 1. the token, compared in constant time → `401`;
 * 2. the permission, against `ServiceCrossingPolicyTag` → `403`. The token
 *    proves the caller is the fleet; it does not say what the caller may do, and
 *    fleet membership is not a capability;
 * 3. the organization header, non-blank → `400`.
 *
 * **The recorded residual** (ADR 0023, not argued away here): a shared secret
 * means any process holding it can name any organization. What bounds it is the
 * permission above, the fact that only the slices needing it are configured with
 * the key, and the request log. What would remove it is an RS256 service token
 * carrying a scope claim, which is named work rather than a gap nobody noticed.

 * credential the security level ([ADR 0052](../../../../../../docs/adr/0052-the-checkout-saga.md)).
