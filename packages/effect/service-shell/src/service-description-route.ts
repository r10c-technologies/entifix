 *
 * The token is fleet membership, which is the right shape here: the readers are
 * `dev-infra:map` and CI, not a person and not a browser.
 *
 * **Logical names only.** Nothing in the response is a URI, and emphatically
 * nothing is `tenant_<organizationId>` — the tenant databases are named after
 * organizations, so leaking one turns a wiring document into a customer list.
 * The names come from a probe's `targets`, which are Store register names by
 * construction.
