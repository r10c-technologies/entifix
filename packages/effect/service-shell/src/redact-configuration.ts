 * Returns a copy of a {@link ConfigurationPlain} safe to expose from a service's

 *
 * Two rules, and the first one carries the weight:
 *
 * 1. Any item the configuration store flagged `isSecret` is blanked outright.
 *    This is what keeps auth-service's RSA private key — a value that mints
 *    `super-admin` tokens for anyone holding it — off a public endpoint. The
 *    flag comes from the store's own `is_secret` column rather than from a
 *    guess about the key's name, because a heuristic that misses once
 *    publishes a signing key.
 * 2. Connection-string credentials are masked even when unflagged, so a URI
 *    someone forgot to flag still does not leak its password.
