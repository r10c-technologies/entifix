/**
 * The reactive stream's browser end: one `EventSource` over a same-origin URL.
 *
 * **Same-origin is the whole reason this is SSE and not a WebSocket.** `entifix_at`
 * is `httpOnly` and `sameSite: 'lax'`, and the `WebSocket` constructor accepts
 * no headers — so a socket would need a second class of bearer token handed to
 * client JavaScript, which is the one thing `httpOnly` protects against. An
 * `EventSource` against the app's own proxy path sends the cookie the way every
 * other call in the repo does (ADR 0036).
 *
 * What it also gets for free is the half #137 would otherwise hand-write:
 * `EventSource` reconnects on its own with backoff and re-sends `Last-Event-ID`.
 * The server accepts that header and ignores it — the stream is a hint that
 * something changed, and the record behind it is the truth.
 *
 * The connection is opened lazily on the first subscriber and closed with the
 * last, so a page that mounts no workspace holds none. One connection per URL,
 * not one per listener: SSE shares the origin's HTTP/1.1 connection budget.
