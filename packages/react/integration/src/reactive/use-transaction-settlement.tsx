 *   moment it happens.
 * - **`onConnect`**, because the stream does not replay (ADR 0036). It fires on
 *   every open *including for a listener registered while already connected*, so
 *   a page load holding a restored pending set and an in-session reconnect take
 *   one path rather than two.
 * - **An interval**, because `STALE` is written by the recovery sweep and emits
 *   no event at all — it is reachable only by asking. It runs only while
 *   something is pending, so an idle workspace polls nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A missing record keeps the entry pending.** `accepted` reaches the
 * tracker over the bus, so with the broker down the entity write commits while
 * no event is ever published and the tracker holds nothing. Rolling back there
 * un-renders a healthy write at exactly the moment nobody can tell a UI bug from
 * an outage. Only `FAILED` and `STALE` are terminal.
