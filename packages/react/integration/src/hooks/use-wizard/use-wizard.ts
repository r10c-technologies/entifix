/**
 * Drives one wizard: where the operator is, what they have answered, and the
 * per-step draft each form step edits.
 *
 * **The draft lives here, above the forms.** A form step calls `useEntityForm`
 * itself — React's hook count must stay fixed, so N form steps cannot be N hook
 * calls in one component — and it unmounts when it is not the active step. What
 * makes Back safe is therefore not keeping the step mounted but keeping its
 * values out of it: {@link UseWizardResult.draftStoreFor} hands the step an
 * `EntityDraftStore` viewing this state, and the step is free to come and go
 * ([ADR 0045](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0045-the-wizard-a-step-graph-and-a-submit-that-hands-off.md)).
 *
 * It holds no router and performs no submit. `onStepChange` reports where the
 * operator went so a shell can write the URL, and finishing is the host's — this
 * hook does not know a transaction exists.
