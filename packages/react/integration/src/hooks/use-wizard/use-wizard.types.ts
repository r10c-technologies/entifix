 * `layer:entifix`, and `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` fails the build on the
 * upward edge. `useWizardDraft` in `@entifix/next-shell` is the one adapter.
 *
 * It is a second port rather than a reuse of `EntityDraftStore` because the two
 * carry different shapes — one holds an `EntityDraft`, this holds a whole
 * {@link WizardState} — and a single port widened to both would let a form be
 * handed a wizard's state by a caller that mixed them up.
