 * consumers reach their service differently — one through the config-driven REST
 * adapters, one through a shell's own same-origin routes — and a hook that knew
 * about both would have to know about neither's layer.
 *
 * The query key sits under `'entity-metadata'`, deliberately **outside** the
 * `['entity', …]` namespace: `useReactiveInvalidation` invalidates
 * `['entity', <key>]` wholesale whenever a row changes, and affordances do not
 * change when a record does. Keeping it out is what stops every save refetching
 * this. `staleTime: Infinity` for the same reason — the document changes with
 * the deployment and the caller's grants, neither of which moves inside a
 * session.
