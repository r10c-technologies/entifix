/**
 * The write half of an entity form: holds the string draft and reports
 * metadata-derived validation, the counterpart to {@link useEntityRecord}
 * (which reads the record it seeds from).
 *
 * It stays out of the transport: it neither fetches nor saves. `onSubmit`
 * receives the validated draft, and the per-entity wrapper reconstructs the
 * domain entity and calls the mutation. The result plugs straight into the
 * agnostic `EntityForm` (`values`/`onFieldChange`/`errors`/`onSubmit`).
 *
 * TanStack Form owns the draft and the submission lifecycle; that is an
 * implementation detail, and the returned shape is deliberately the plain
 * `values`/`errors`/`setField`/`submit`/`isDirty` facade so `EntityForm` — which
 * renders native inputs and knows nothing about any form library — stays
 * agnostic. Fields are therefore never registered through `form.Field`; a
 * form-level validator reporting `{ fields }` reaches them anyway, because
 * `FormApi` creates meta for any field name an error arrives for.
 *
 * `revalidateLogic` is what makes a pristine form quiet: nothing validates until
 * the first submit, and every keystroke revalidates after it. Running one
 * validator under a single cause also keeps a fixed field from holding a stale
 * message left behind by another cause.
 *
 * The seed applies once, so a caller that loads its record after mount keys the
 * form by the record id to reseed — the same convention `EntityForm`'s wrappers
 * already follow.
