 * Replacing the seed outright is how that disagreement becomes a bug the user
 * sees: a member added since the draft was written has no entry, reaches the form
 * engine as `undefined`, and its input flips from controlled to uncontrolled
 * mid-render. A member since removed goes the other way, surviving as a value
 * nothing renders and `reconstructEntity` cannot assign.
 *
 * So the seed decides the *keys* and the draft decides the *values*: a name the

 * lacks keeps its seeded value.
 *
 * **A value is restored only in the shape its member can hold**, which is now
 * two shapes rather than one. A scalar takes a string; a `composition` takes a
 * readable row list. Anything else is dropped back to its seed — a member that
 * changed type between the write and the read, or a row list from a build that
 * did not carry keys, restores as the record's own value instead of as
 * something no editor can render. This is per member, so one unreadable entry
 * never costs the user the rest of the form.
 *
 * This is the shape guard at the one place the shape is actually known. The
 * store-level version check (`drafts-state.ts`) can only decide that a whole
 * generation of drafts is unreadable; it cannot know which members one entity
