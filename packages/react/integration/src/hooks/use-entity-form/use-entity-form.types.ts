/**
 * Where an autosaved draft is persisted, as the form sees it.
 *
 * A **port**, because the store cannot be imported: `useDraft` and the zustand
 * store behind it are `layer:shell`, this package is `layer:entifix`, and
 * `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` fails the build on the upward edge. Retagging
 * to make it legal would put an IndexedDB store under the framework layer, so
 * the shell implements this instead — `useEntityDraft` in `@entifix/next-shell`
 * is the one adapter today.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `@entifix/core`, and the asymmetry with
 * `EntityLinkSource` is deliberate: that port sits in core because
 * `@entifix/react-controls` and `@entifix/react-integration` are both
 * `entifix:react` and may not import each other, so they *had* to meet below
 * both. Nothing forces that here — `@entifix/next-shell` already imports this
 * hook — so the port stays beside the options it joins.
 *
 * Everything it carries is JSON round-trippable, because a draft is written
 * through `createJSONStorage`
 * ([ADR 0032](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0032-what-may-live-in-an-autosaved-draft.md)).
 * `EntityDraft` is that guarantee's compile-time half.
