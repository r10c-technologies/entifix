/**
 * A floating command bar: search destinations, records and commands, and run
 * them from the keyboard.
 *
 * Presentational, and strictly so. It holds no index, performs no fetch and
 * knows no router — every group arrives already filtered, already authorized and
 * already translated, from hooks in the shell layer that meet this component at
 * the framework-free `CommandSource` port in core. That is the same arrangement
 * `EntityLinkSource` uses, and it exists because `@entifix/react-controls` may
 * not import `@entifix/react-integration`.
 *
 * **The sources filter, not this component.** A record group is filtered by the
 * service that answered it; a command group is filtered by the hook that built
 * it. Filtering again here would mean the palette had to know which groups were
 * pre-filtered, and a group that answered a *different* term would be silently
 * emptied rather than shown as stale.
 *
 * Depth is a **stack of pages**: selecting an option carrying `push` makes the
 * palette become that page. `Escape` pops one level and closes at the root;
 * `Backspace` on an empty term pops too, which is the gesture Raycast trained
 * people on and costs nothing when there is nothing to pop.
 *
 * Built on Headless UI's `Dialog` + `Combobox`, so the focus trap, focus
 * restoration, `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-activedescendant` and
 * the arrow-key contract are the library's rather than seven hand-written
 * behaviours that each have to be right.
