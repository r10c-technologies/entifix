/**

 * have to be a typed relation: when the target lives in **another slice's
 * store**, an `EntityLink` would be an illegal edge and a storage-layer join
 * across a store boundary, so the member is a plain id and the relation exists
 * only in the operator's head (ADR 0022, and `ProductSpecification.brandId` is
 * the live case). Nothing about the editor cares which of the two it is —
 * `EntityLinkInput` writes `String(target.id)` into the draft either way, and
 * the *only* place `link`-ness still matters is `applyEntityLinks` at submit,
 * which skips a non-`link` descriptor and so leaves the id as the truth.
 *
 * Everything else is excluded on purpose rather than by omission: a `boolean`,
 * `enum`, `number` or `date` member cannot name another record, so a source
 * pointed at one is a wiring mistake — see {@link assertLinkSourcesAreEditable}.

 * needs no bespoke form. The read/edit toggle is the whole point — the same

 *
 * Two things layer on top of that default:
 * - **modes** — `read` renders each member through `CellValue`; `edit` renders
 *   the matching `FieldControl`. A member in {@link PICKABLE_TYPES} with an
 *   entry in `linkSources` gets the full picker instead — a to-one `link`, or a
 *   `string` holding a foreign key into another slice's store. Without a source,
 *   a relation stays read-only, and a `linkCollection` always does, the to-many
 *   editor being a follow-up. A source aimed at a member that can render no
 *   picker is a wiring mistake rather than a no-op, and throws.
 * - **slots** — `<EntityField>` children override one field's label, control or
 *   read display, or add a computed field.
 *
 * It is presentational: the draft, its errors and the save/delete actions are
 * all props, so the same form hosts on a plain route and inside a workspace tab.
