 * The button's visual recipe, kept in its own module so it can be shared with

 *
 * `Button` is `'use client'` for a single reason — it renders HeadlessUI's
 * `Button` — and a server page that puts one inside every card in a grid pays a
 * client boundary per card. `cva` and the token classes have no such
 * constraint, so a link-shaped variant (`ButtonLink`) can wear the same clothes
 * and still render entirely on the server.
