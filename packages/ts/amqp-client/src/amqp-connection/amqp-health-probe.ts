 * Registers a readiness probe for the AMQP connection: a passive assert of the

 * asks the broker whether the exchange is there, which fails fast on both a
 * dead connection and a broker that lost the topology.
 *
 * It runs through the connector rather than against a held channel, and that
 * matters more than it looks: amqplib **closes the channel** when a passive
 * check fails. Against a single boot-time channel one failed probe therefore
 * killed publishing and consuming permanently — the readiness check was itself
 * a way to break the bus. Now the dead channel is simply dropped and the next
 * call reopens one.
