/**
 * The saga engine, split at the 202 boundary so validation/lock failures are
 * synchronous (mapped to `400`/`409`) while the write runs asynchronously:
 *
 * - {@link acceptTransaction} — validate -> claim -> lock. Runs before the
 *   service answers `202`; its failures are the client's answer.
 * - {@link completeTransaction} — execute -> free, or rollback -> record
 *   `failed` -> free. Forked after `202`; `free` always runs via `ensuring`, so
 *   locks never leak on a rollback path.
 *
 * **The engine never publishes.** Every event it produces goes to the
 * {@link TransactionOutbox}, and a relay carries the outbox to the broker. That
 * is the whole fix for the dual write: an event that only ever existed in a
 * `bus.publish` call between two Mongo writes is lost when the broker is down,
 * and the transaction is then mislabelled `STALE` despite having succeeded.
 */

/**
 * Accept phase (synchronous).
 *
 * The order is deliberate: validate, then **claim, then lock**. The claim is the
 * outbox insert for the `accepted` event, and its uniqueness on
 * the message id (`<transactionId>:<step>`) is what makes the client-generated
 * id an idempotency key — a replayed command is recognised here, before a lock is taken and
 * before any work is forked. Locking first would make a retry queue behind its
 * own original.
