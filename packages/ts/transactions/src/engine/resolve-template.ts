/**
 * Resolve the placeholders inside a **request body**, recursively.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Why a body needs this at all.** A step's payload can depend on what an
 * earlier step created: checkout's capture has to name the order that was just
 * written, and the order id is minted by order-service — so a caller cannot put
 * it in the body it sends when it starts the flow. Without this, the capture
 * carries a placeholder string and the order it names never advances, which is
 * precisely the defect measured on the live lab: a saga reporting `COMPLETED`
 * with a payment attached to nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The template lives in the caller's `inputs`, never in the definition.**
 * That is ADR 0039's constraint, not an accident: a definition that carried
 * domain payloads would be importing the shape of another domain's entity, which
 * is the class of thing that has no legal home. The definition stays a list of
 * verbs and addresses; what to send is the caller's, and this only lets the
 * caller point at a value it could not have known yet.
 *
 * Two behaviours, and the difference is load-bearing:
 *
 * - A string that is **exactly** one placeholder resolves to the raw value, so
 *   a number stays a number and an object stays an object. `"{steps.x.data.qty}"`
 *   becoming the string `"3"` would reach a validator expecting a number.
 * - A string that merely **contains** placeholders is interpolated textually,
 *   and — unlike {@link resolveTemplate} — **not** URI-encoded. A body is JSON,
 *   not a path segment; encoding here would put `%20` in a customer's name.
 *
 * An unresolved placeholder throws, for the same reason it does in a path.
