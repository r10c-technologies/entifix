 * data" rather than as "none" — so `STALE` falling to zero would look exactly

 * choreographed. A flow spanning slices is orchestrated instead, from a
 * declarative definition (ADR 0039), and its coordinator both reads these and
 * issues the next step — but that engine is not built, and single-step writes
 * stay exactly as described here when it is.
 *
 * `transactionId` and `at` are also reachable as the message's `correlationId`
 * and `at`. That duplication is deliberate and standard (CloudEvents' `subject`
 * does the same): metadata is what the *transport* routes and deduplicates on,
 * and the payload has to stand on its own for a consumer that has already
 * unwrapped it.
