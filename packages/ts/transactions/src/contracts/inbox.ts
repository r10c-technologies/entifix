 * There is deliberately **no `claimWithin(session)` here**, for the reason

 * session, it inserts the document {@link InboxClaim} describes, and this port
 * is what a consumer that can claim standalone uses instead.
 *
 * It follows that **the inbox lives with the side effect, not in one central
 * place**: the claim and the write must be in the same database to be one fact.
