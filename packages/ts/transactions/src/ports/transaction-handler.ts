   * transactions with a `TransientTransactionError` the *application* is
   * expected to retry; and keep any non-transactional side effect — drawing a
   * code from the Redis sequence, say — **outside** that retried callback, or a
   * retry consumes a second value and skips a code.

   * anything else there.** `rollback` runs on exactly one arm — the one where
   * `execute` failed — so there is no outcome to hand it.
   *
   * That is a property of this path rather than an unfinished signature, and it
   * stays true now that the multi-step engine exists beside it. A saga's
   * compensation is dispatched by `runSaga` with **its own call's** recorded
   * outcome (`SagaStepOutcome`), because reversing a reservation needs the
   * reservation's id and a delete-if-exists does not — see
   * [ADR 0052](../../../../../../docs/adr/0052-the-checkout-saga.md). A
   * single-step handler is untouched by that, which is what ADR 0039 meant by
   * "grows a second shape and keeps the first".
