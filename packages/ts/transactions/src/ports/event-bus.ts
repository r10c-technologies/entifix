/**
 * How a subscriber's queue is shaped, which is a property of the *workload*
 * rather than of the transport (ADR 0030).
 *
 * - `work` — a named, durable queue that survives the consumer's restart and
 *   accumulates while it is gone. Replicas share it, so each message reaches
 *   exactly one of them. A projection writer, a fold and a settlement consumer
 *   all want this.
 * - `broadcast` — a connection-scoped exclusive queue, so every replica
 *   receives every message and nothing is retained across a restart. Correct
 *   only when the replicas differ from one another — a socket push holding
 *   different clients per process.
 *
 * ADR 0029 built the exclusive queue for every subscriber and gave a stated
 * reason: a shared queue delivers each event to one replica, "which reads as
 * flakiness rather than as a design". That reasoning is right for `broadcast`
 * and wrong for `work`; it picked broadcast semantics for a workload that is
 * work, at a time when the only subscriber made the difference invisible.
