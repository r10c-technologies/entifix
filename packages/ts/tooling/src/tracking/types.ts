/**
 * The product-analytics facade. Deliberately NOT sharing an interface with
 * logging: tracking is a different concern (business events + experiments for
 * PMs/growth, long-retained and user-identified) that fans out to a different
 * backend (PostHog), unlike observability logs. Same package, separate module.
 *
 * A real adapter (see `@entifix/posthog`) implements this
 * interface; it is provided per environment behind `TrackerTag` (Effect
 * `Context.Tag`, in `@entifix/business`) — the browser and backend both
 * run Effect DI, so the same seam works in each.
