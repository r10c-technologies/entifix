 * not check a signature, so wiring this into anything reachable from a network
 * is an open door. It exists so an example can serve `$metadata` without an
 * identity provider — and it does that by replacing the *port*, not by adding
 * an unauthenticated branch to `entity-metadata-route.ts`. ADR 0026's point is
 * that the descriptor is filtered by the verified principal; a hole punched in
 * the route for a demo would become the adoption pattern.
