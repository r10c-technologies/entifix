/**
 * The outbox half of ADR 0001's first metric set.
 *
 * It lives beside the relay that samples it rather than in any one service,
 * because three slices now own an outbox — `catalog`, `order` and `payment` —
 * and the warning below is exactly why a copy per service is not an option: an
 * Effect metric is keyed on its **description**, so three hand-maintained
 * definitions of `outbox_pending_entries` are three series the moment one
 * wording drifts, and a dashboard would go quiet without failing anything.
 *
 * ⚠️ The metric objects are **exported so a reader uses the same instance**. An
 * Effect metric's registry key includes its description, so rebuilding one by
 * name without the description addresses a different series that is permanently
 * zero — a silent way to write a query against nothing.
 *
 * These are gauges rather than counters because they describe a *backlog*: the
 * question is how many are waiting right now, not how many there have ever
 * been. They are sampled by the two daemons that already run on an interval, so
 * nothing new is scheduled to produce them.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A dimensionless gauge reaches Prometheus with a `_ratio` suffix.** That
 * is the OTel exporter's convention for unit `1`, not a mistake here, so
 * `outbox_pending_entries` is queried as `outbox_pending_entries_ratio`.
 * Counters are unaffected. Where a metric has a real unit, tag it — see
 * {@link outboxOldestPendingAge}.

 * log line, so how far behind the outbox has fallen is otherwise unanswerable.
 * A depth that is flat and an age that climbs is the signature of a relay whose
