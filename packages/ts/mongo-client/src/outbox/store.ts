/**
 * The outbox collection, and it lives in the **same database as the entity it
 * describes** — never in a shared control-plane store.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second only shows up later. Same database means the
 * entity write and its event are one single-database transaction, which stays a
 * single-*shard* transaction if this ever shards; a control-plane outbox would
 * be cross-database from the first commit. And an outbox holds event payloads:
 * a `TransactionEvent` carries no tenant data, but `catalog.published` carries a
 * whole offering and `order.placed` a whole receipt, and neither may land in the
 * control plane on its way to the bus.
 *
 * That rule is why this lives here rather than in one service. It applies
 * identically to a per-organization `tenant_<id>` and to a single platform-plane
 * database, and the second publisher is what turned a copy into a seam
 * ([ADR 0028](../../../../../../docs/adr/0028-the-transaction-id-is-the-clients-and-its-event-ships-with-the-write.md)).

 *
 * The unique one is load-bearing rather than defensive: it *is* the idempotency
 * check behind the client-generated transaction id, so a replayed command is
 * rejected by the storage engine rather than by a read-then-write race. It is on
 * `eventId` — `<transactionId>:<step>` for a transaction — so the claim and the
 * bus's deduplication key are one value rather than two that can drift. The
 * partial one keeps the relay's `pending` query cheap once the collection fills
 * with sent entries; it filters on `quarantined` too, so an entry past its
 * ceiling leaves the index rather than being read and skipped forever.
 *
 * Mongo rejects a `createIndex` that reuses a key pattern with a different
 * `partialFilterExpression` (`IndexOptionsConflict`), and this runs on every
 * sweep and every create. A database that predates the `quarantined` filter
 * therefore fails here on every pass — which is loud only because the sweep now
 * logs what it catches. The fix is `pnpm run <app>:dev:reset`; nothing runs in
 * production, so there is no migration to write.
