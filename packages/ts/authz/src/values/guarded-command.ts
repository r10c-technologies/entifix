 * reach, so a `scope:shared` shell can contribute commands to whichever host
 * mounts it without either of them importing the other.
 *
 * It is a *separate* type rather than a nav item with a flag because the two
 * answer different questions. A nav item is a place you can be; a command is
 * something you can do, and it is the thing that has keywords, a page and no
 * sidebar row. Folding them would put `keywordsKey` on every destination and
 * `type` on every command.
 *
 * `labelKey`/`keywordsKey` are **namespace-qualified catalog keys**, not copy —
 * whoever renders the palette does not own the wording, and spelling the
 * namespace out is also what makes an `app:` key visible to the lint rule that
 * keeps those inside `apps/`.
 *
 * Filtering on `permission`/`entitled` is **presentation only**, exactly as it
 * is for navigation: the route behind the command is what refuses the request.
