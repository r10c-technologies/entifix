/**
 * The shared Playwright configuration for an entifix app e2e project.
 *
 * The profile decides three things, and specs decide none of them:
 *
 * - **which specs run** — by filename (`*.mock.spec.ts` / `*.live.spec.ts`).
 *   Selection by `testIgnore` rather than by an in-spec `test.skip` means a
 *   run with the wrong environment fails instead of quietly reporting green.
 * - **the base URL** — the local app in `mock`; in `live` the app is expected
 *   to already be running (started with its real backend), so Playwright
 *   reuses it rather than racing a second one.
 * - **whether a reused server is acceptable** — `mock` refuses a development
 *   one, `live` accepts whatever is there. Enforced by an auto fixture in
 *   `defineEntifixE2eTest`, not from here: Playwright loads `globalSetup`
 *   through a different module path than the one it uses for the config and the
 *   specs, and this package is `"type": "module"` while an app's
 *   `playwright.config.ts` is CJS — a file reached both ways transpiles for one
 *   and fails for the other. See `assertExpectedServer`.
 *
 * Browsers are chromium in both profiles unless `E2E_BROWSERS=all`.
