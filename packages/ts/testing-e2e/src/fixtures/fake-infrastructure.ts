 * Mongo repository, the Redis lock and sequence services and the AMQP event bus
 * all still run their own code. Substituting at the port level instead would
 * leave the filter translation, the `SET NX PX` and the envelope framing
 * unexecuted while the suite reported the service as covered.
 *
 * Each helper returns the fake alongside its Layer, because a spec usually
 * wants both: the Layer to boot with, the fake to seed, inspect or break.
 *
 * The casts are `never` on purpose: it keeps this package free of the mongodb,
 * ioredis and amqplib type packages while staying honest that these are not
 * real drivers.
