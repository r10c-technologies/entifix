/**
 * The [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) v1 contract, vendored.
 *
 * Standard Schema is an interface, not a library: Zod, Valibot and ArkType all
 * expose `~standard` and nothing else is needed to run one. Declaring it here
 * lets an entity carry a real schema without `@entifix/core` — the bottom of
 * the stack — taking a runtime dependency on any validation library, and keeps
 * whichever one a domain picks an implementation detail of that domain.
 *
 * Only the parts a caller needs to *run* a schema are vendored; the inference
 * helpers from the published package are left out deliberately, since a draft
 * arrives as strings and is validated, never parsed into a typed value here.
