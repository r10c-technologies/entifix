/**
 * Discriminates what {@link EntifixEnvelope.data} carries.
 *
 * `command` extends the contract for the transactions layer: a write is issued
 * as a `command`, whose `data` shape lives in `@entifix/transactions` —
 * core only owns the discriminant so every artifact agrees on it.
 *
 * `event` is what actually rides the bus, and it is deliberately not named
 * after one publisher's flow: once a message can be `catalog.published` as
 * easily as `transaction.completed`, `transactionEvent` would be the wrong
 * name for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The four transaction-shaped discriminants below are four because they
 * carry four shapes.** `transactionEvent` used to mean all of them, and a
 * discriminant that means several things asserts nothing when it is read —
 * which is what `readTransactionEventEnvelope` was doing on the `202`: checking
 * a name that the record route and the event type both also answered to
 * ([ADR 0055](../../../../../../docs/adr/0055-a-coordinator-resumes-from-its-own-record.md),
 * #176).
 *
 * - `transactionAccepted` — the `202` accept body, `{ transactionId, state }`.
 *   Not a record: it has no `createdAt` and names no entity id yet.
 * - `transactionRecord` — the fold a client polls, a `TransactionRecord`.
 * - `sagaResult` — how a settled multi-step walk ended: which steps ran and
 *   what each returned ([ADR 0052](../../../../../../docs/adr/0052-the-checkout-saga.md)).
 * - `sagaInstance` — the durable instance itself, which is what a resumable
 *   coordinator reads and what `GET /api/saga/:id` serves. It differs from
 *   `sagaResult` in carrying the inputs and the resume count, because those are
 *   what an operator needs to answer *why is this one still here*.
 *
 * `entityMetadata` is the same extension made once more, for the action model:
 * its `data` is an {@link EntityMetadataDocument}, which core does own because
 * both the service that computes it and the controls that render it are already
 * below the layer that would otherwise host it.
