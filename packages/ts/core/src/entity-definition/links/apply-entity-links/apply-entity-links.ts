/**
 * The instances a user picked, keyed by accessor name — the sidecar to a form's
 * string draft.
 *
 * A draft holds ids because it must stay JSON (a workspace autosaves it), but an
 * id alone cannot be written as an embedded relation. So the picker remembers the
 * instance it handed over, and this map is that memory.
 *
 * It is a *cache*, and it is not persisted — it dies with the page, and a
 * restored draft arrives holding ids and nothing else. What refills it is
 * `EntityLinkSource.selected.entity`, which resolves the id the draft did keep.
 * For an `id` member a missing entry costs nothing; for an `embedded` one
 * {@link applyEntityLinks} throws rather than write the wrong wire shape.

 * This is the counterpart to `serializeEntity`, which inlines a link whenever it
 * `isLoaded`: an `embedded` member therefore needs the picked instance handed to
 * `setValue`, while an `id` member must be given only the scalar even when the
 * instance is at hand — otherwise the wire shape would flip the moment a picker
 * happened to hold the target.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free, so the same reconstruction runs in a browser form and
 * in a backend use-case that assembles an entity from a raw draft.
 *
 * `linkCollection` members are left untouched: the to-many editor is a follow-up,
 * and this is the branch where `setIds`/`setValues` will land.
 *
 * Throws {@link EntifixLogicError} when an `embedded` member holds an id with no
 * instance to inline — see the branch below for why that is a fault and not a
 * fallback.
