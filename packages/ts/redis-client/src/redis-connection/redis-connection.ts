 *
 * The reconnect policy is spelled out rather than left to defaults, because two
 * defaults are actively wrong for a service with a readiness endpoint:
 *
 * - **`enableOfflineQueue: false`** — the default queues commands while the
 *   connection is down, so a health probe *hangs* instead of failing. Readiness
 *   has to answer fastest exactly when a datastore is gone.
 * - **an explicit `retryStrategy`** — so a connection that drops (Redis
 *   restarted, pod rescheduled) is re-established for the lifetime of the
 *   process. Without it the client can settle into a terminal state and the
 *   service stays degraded until someone restarts it, even after Redis is back.
