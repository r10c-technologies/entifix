 *
 * The endpoint is unauthenticated on purpose: a readiness check must not spend
 * a credential, and `/debug/ready` reveals nothing beyond "this instance is
 * serving". The deadline matters as much as the check, because an instance that
 * is mid-init accepts the connection and then simply does not answer — which
 * would leave readiness hanging at the one moment it must reply.
