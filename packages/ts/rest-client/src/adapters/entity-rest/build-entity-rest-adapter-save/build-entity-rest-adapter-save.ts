/**
 * Persists an entity over HTTP.
 *
 * An entity without an id has never been stored, so it is created with `POST`
 * against the collection; one with an id is replaced with `PUT` against its own
 * URL.
 *
 * For a plain create the response envelope — not the request — is what gets
 * deserialized and returned, because the service is the authority on the stored
 * entity (it assigns ids and may normalize fields).
 *
 * A **transactional** create inverts that, and deliberately. The service answers
 * `202` describing a transaction rather than an entity, so there is no stored
 * entity to read back yet: the client mints the transaction id, which *is* the
 * id the entity will be stored under, and returns the entity it already holds.
 * That is the point of the client owning the id (ADR 0028) — before it, this
 * adapter parsed the `202` as an entity envelope, failed, and reported an error
 * for a create that was in fact about to succeed.
