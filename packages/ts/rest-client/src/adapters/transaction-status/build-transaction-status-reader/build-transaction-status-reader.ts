 * commits — the outbox is in the same Mongo transaction — while no event is ever
 * published and the tracker holds no record at all. A caller that treated this
 * as terminal would un-render a healthy write during a broker outage, which is
 * the moment nobody can tell a UI bug from an outage (ADR 0043). The route also
 * answers `404` for another tenant's record, deliberately, so it cannot be
 * walked to probe ids that are also primary keys — indistinguishable here, and
 * correctly so: neither is a record this caller may reconcile against.
