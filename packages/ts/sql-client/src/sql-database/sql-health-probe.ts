 * a database that has gone away, so only a query that crosses the wire can tell
 * the two apart. For config-service in particular, being reachable while unable
 * to read its table is precisely the state the rest of the fleet needs to hear
 * about — every service resolves its settings from there.
 *
 * Merge it beside the client layer in a service's `AppLayer` and readiness starts
 * reporting the database, with nothing in the service describing the probe — so
 * it cannot drift from the dependency it describes.
 *
 * `stores` names the Stores this connection backs, by their register name in
 * `tools/slices/`. See {@link MongoHealthProbeLayer} for why it is the
 * composition root's to supply and why it is a list (ADR 0031).
