/**
 * The `/routing` entry point exists so Next middleware — which runs on the edge
 * — can negotiate a locale without pulling the i18next runtime into its bundle.
 * Nothing in the type system enforces that, so it is asserted here: the day
 * someone re-exports `createI18n` for convenience, this fails rather than
 * quietly inflating every app's edge bundle.
 *
 * The implementation moved to `@entifix/core`, which is what makes a middleware
 * bundle free of this package entirely — so the agreement asserted below is with
 * core rather than with this package's own barrel.
