/**
 * Fails when an entry in an accessibility ratchet list names an issue that is
 * already closed.
 *
 * A Storybook `a11y-todo.json` and a screen `a11y-baseline.json` both accept a
 * known violation on the promise that the named issue removes it (ADR 0024). Once
 * that issue closes the promise is spent: either the fix landed and the entry
 * is stale, or the issue closed without it and the entry is now permanent
 * debt. Both want a person, so this runs outside `Done` — on a schedule, and
 * whenever an issue closes — rather than failing pull requests that did
 * neither.
 *
 *   node tools/ci/a11y-todo.mjs $(git ls-files '*a11y-todo.json' '*a11y-baseline.json')
 *
 * Reads issue state through `gh`, which needs `GH_TOKEN` in CI.
