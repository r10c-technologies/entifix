/**
 * Fails when a committed accessibility baseline gains an entry relative to the
 * merge base.
 *
 * A baseline accepts the violations a screen had when its gate was switched
 * on, each against the issue that removes it (ADR 0024). Its only legitimate
 * direction afterwards is down. `A11Y_BASELINE=update` rewrites one happily,
 * so a pull request that ran it to make a regression pass would otherwise
 * merge with the regression accepted. A baseline that did not exist at the
 * merge base is new, and is the one place entries are added.
